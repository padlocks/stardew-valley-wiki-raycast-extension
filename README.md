# Stardew Valley Wiki
This is a simple Raycast extension that helps me search through Stardew Valley wiki while still in-game.

## TODO
- [ ] Create new command-icon.png
- [ ] Actually read the content of the URLs so opening browser won't be needed


## Requirements
Please refer to https://developers.raycast.com/basics/getting-started

## Installing the extension
- Clone this repo
- Run `npm run build`
